# Kinerra Project Roadmap

The following roadmap is a summary of Kinerra project development, which has been organized into four stages: Stage 1, Stage 2, Liftoff, and Docking. Each stage is centered around a set of functionalities that will be delivered across multiple code releases.

While the stages of Kinerra will be delivered sequentially, the work for each stage happens in parallel, with research, prototyping, and development often in progress all at once across the different development streams.

The work of each stage is gathered and presented on its dedicated page. Here you will find an overview of the goals of each stage, as well as descriptions of the core functional components, status updates, and current changelogs.

# Kinerra Project Roadmap

The following roadmap is a summary of [Kinerra](https://kinerra.net) project development, which has been organized into four stages: [Stage 1](#stage-1), [Stage 2](#stage-2), [Liftoff](#liftoff), and [Docking](#docking). Each stage is centered around a set of functionalities that will be delivered across multiple code releases.

While the stages of [Kinerra](https://kinerra.net) will be delivered sequentially, the work for each stage happens in parallel, with research, prototyping, and development often in progress all at once across the different development streams.

The work of each stage is gathered and presented on its dedicated page. Here you will find an overview of the goals of each stage, as well as descriptions of the core functional components, status updates, and current changelogs.

## Stage 1

**Closed Beta Server Launch**

Closed Beta is an early, and unrefined release of [Kinerra](https://kinerra.net) Game Server, and it marks the initial step in a multi-stage rollout process detailed in the project's roadmap. During the Closed Beta, only a selected number of users will be able to join and test out the server's features and functionality. The total number of users allowed to join the Closed Beta is currently limited to **125** (100 free slots & 25 Early Access slots). The registration will be open to the public and access will be assigned on a first-come-first-served basis. Additionally, users will be able to gain access to the Closed Beta by applying to our Early Access Programme. Find out more about the Early Access Programme [here](link) (WIP).
During [Stage 1](#stage-1) and [Stage 2](#stage-2) user feedback and bug reporting are absolutely vital to making Kinerra even better, and to ensure we have a smooth [Liftoff](#liftoff) as we go public. By submiting feedback & effective bug reports during our closed and open beta, users will be rewarded KIN based on the severity of the bug they've reported, and the time they have spent on submiting feedback.

Release date: *February 2021*.

## Stage 2

**Open Beta Server Launch**

The Open Beta stage marks the first iteration of the Kinerra Wallet. It will allow players to send, receive, and exchange KIN without ever leaving the game. As the first version of the Kinerra Wallet will run on Solana Testnet, players will also be able to fund their in-game wallets using a token faucet. The total number of users allowed to join the Open Beta is currently limited to **500**, as this will help us keep the hardware costs of running the server to a minimum. The users are not required to register in order to join the Open Beta. When the number of concurrent users (CCU) is >= 500, the login server will stop accepting new connections. The number of CCU will rise and fall irregularly at different times of the day, opening new slots for users to join. During Open Beta, players may experience latency issues depending on the distance between their physical location and the server. We had run a few tests on different server locations around the world and have decided that Newark USA, at roughly 83ms ping to most of Europe is a good choice. We're also looking at implementing proxy servers in Frankfurt, Tokyo, Singapore, and Toronto. We'll constantly monitor server performance and make adjustments as needed.

Release date: *March 2021*.

## Liftoff

**Public Server Launch**

Release date: *April 2021*.

## Docking

**Android & iOS App Launch**

The Kinerra mobile app will be developed using React Native because of its capability to cover Android as well as iOS devices simultaneously. By logging in and linking their game accounts, players will be able to perform different actions related to their account as well as check their progress on the go. Users will also have the option to earn KIN in the app, by watching 15-30s ads served by the [Kin Ads Network](https://www.kinads.org).

**Features**

- View in-game KIN balance
- View character statistics
- View upcoming castle and fortress siege dates
- View the clans and alliances list 
- View the latest server leaderboards
- View global server statistics

Release date: *June 2021*.

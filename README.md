# Kinerra Project Roadmap

The following roadmap is a summary of [Kinerra](https://kinerra.net) project development, which has been organized into four stages: [Stage 1](#stage-1), [Stage 2](#stage-2), [Liftoff](#liftoff), and [Docking](#docking). Each stage is centered around a set of functionalities that will be delivered across multiple code releases.

While the stages of [Kinerra](https://kinerra.net) will be delivered sequentially, the work for each stage happens in parallel, with research, prototyping, and development often in progress all at once across the different development streams.

The work of each stage is gathered and presented on its dedicated page. Here you will find an overview of the goals of each stage, as well as descriptions of the core functional components, status updates, and current changelogs.

## Stage 1

**Closed Beta Server Launch**

Closed Beta is an early, and unrefined release of [Kinerra](https://kinerra.net) Game Server, and it marks the initial step in a multi-stage rollout process detailed in the project's roadmap. During the Closed Beta, only a selected number of users will be able to join and test out the server's features and functionality. The total number of users allowed to join the Closed Beta is currently limited to **125** (100 free slots & 25 Early Access slots). The registration will be open to the public and access will be assigned on a first-come-first-served basis. Additionally, users will be able to gain access to the Closed Beta by applying to our Early Access Programme. Find out more about the Early Access Programme [here](link) (WIP).
During [Stage 1](#stage-1) and [Stage 2](#stage-2) user feedback and bug reporting are absolutely vital to making Kinerra even better, and to ensure we have a smooth [Liftoff](#liftoff) as we go public. By submiting feedback & effective bug reports during our closed and open beta, users will be rewarded KIN based on the severity of the bug they've reported, and the time they have spent on submiting feedback.
